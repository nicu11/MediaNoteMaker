# MediaNoteMaker

I often find myself taking notes whenever I play a game or watch a show. I write down the names of characters, what happens to them, and important notes about them. That way, if I pick up the show/game again after a long time, I don't feel like I've been left behind by the show. If a name is mentioned, I can glance at my notes and remind myself about who this person is. In video-games, I also write down places where I can't progress yet (if I find a gap that is too long to jump right now, for instance), so that when I have the appropriate upgrade/item I can return to that place. This helps me a lot.

However, I have been doing this with word-documents in my phone. Not exactly the most flexible of environments and it often gets a bit too big after a while, it becomes difficult to find the information I need after a while. So, I figure that I might as well develop an application to help me with this.

It is programmed in Java using Spring Boot for the backend, and the front-end will be made available both using a windows application (for if I'm sitting at the computer) and for a mobile phone (if I'm sitting in front of the TV).
